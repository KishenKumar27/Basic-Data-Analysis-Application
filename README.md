# Basic-Data-Analysis-Application

   A task has been given to the MMU’s ERU by the higher officials of MMU which is they need to
know the progress of students in some specific subjects which the students were enrolled in. In
order to know the progress of them, ERU has to make an analysis of the scores achieved by the
students in the specific subjects. However, ERU has to manually execute the analysis. By
performing such complications, it would be very troublesome. In other words, the processes are
neither effective nor efficient as time has been wasted in performing the compilation. An example
is when the scores of the students for the specific subjects is stored in Excel file format. The
calculations can be very hard if the records are stored in an Excel spreadsheet. Thus, it will cause
a lot of trouble in producing an analysis report. We can say that it is not efficient as calculating data
one by one might cause duplication of data due to human error. This duplication eventually leads
to data redundancy and this is caused by no checking of data during calculation.

   To answer the question of “How to replace this manual method?”, it can be done by using the
basic data analysis application that has been built by our team. This app has the ability to read
from the Excel file format and do the mathematical calculations by using the data in the file. Not
only that, the output of this app will be shown in the tabular form which will be located in the excel
file that has been read by the app. This app still can do the analysis even if we change the inputs
of the data. The main feature of this app is it can generate statistical reports based on the given
data and store it in a text file.
